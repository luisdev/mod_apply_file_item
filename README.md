# mod_apply_file_item
Application Form File item type

Contains the 'file_item' file type that adds the capability to attach files to application forms.
Add this item type to your form and users will have the option to upload files,
via a file picker control, to the forms that they are submitting.

To install just copy the 'file' folder, containing the file_form.php and lib.php files,
into your \mod\apply\item\ folder.
After doing that you'll have a new item type listed on the 'Add entry items to activity'
select list. Select the 'File' option on that list and you'll get the option to add this
new object to your form.
